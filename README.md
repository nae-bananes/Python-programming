# Python-programming

## What is this page for?

This is a small space to scrap some new things that I learn with the ebook "Learn Python Programmaing, Fabrizio Romano, Heinrich Kruge (2024)". All comments are a part of the book added some of my personal questions, comments and some complementary information searched online. Codes are from the examples of the book. 

I have few years of experience in programming in Python but mostly for Data analysis and Data Science. I wish to improve my programming skills in Python, especially in Object-oriented programming (OOP). I believe that obtaining a more competitive level of Python programming skills helps building a fancier and neater Data works, given that I always dream of working on the end-to-end Data solution providing-kind Data Science projects. I have few experiences on it, and it requires more of confrontation with the engineering part, shells and optimal programming skills. It makes the job more challenging and interesting than just a Data mining skills... We have seen all data wrangling techniques so similar between them in different packages of Python and R environments, there is some limitations in learning!

This public GITHUB page will be mildstones of my learning journey with this book. Please join me in this adventure if you want to progress with me! :)
